# Build-the-similation-model-of-the-system

The objectives of this assignment are: to convert a description of a system into a simulation model of that system; to implement that simulation in a shared memory concurrent programming language; to use the implemented simulation to explore the behaviour of a complex system; to gain a better understanding of safety and liveness issues in concurrent systems.

# Part 1. Concurrency in Java

This Ô¨Årst part of the assignment deals with programming threads in Java. Our task is to implement a concurrent simulation of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. The specific requirement is described in [Assignment 1a](https://github.com/vivianjia123/Build-the-similation-model-of-the-system/blob/main/con_asg_1a-1.pdf).

# Part 2. Concurrency in FSP

This second part of the assignment is to model the system in FSP, use LTSA to check it, and to identify and mitigate any problems that we discover through modelling. The specific requirement is described in [Assignment 1b](https://github.com/vivianjia123/Build-the-similation-model-of-the-system/blob/main/con_asg_1b.pdf).
